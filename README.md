Setup
=====

First things first, time to set up your Python environment. Because of the scope of this project, I am assuming the game is being developed and tested in a Windows environment.

1. Download and install the latest stable Python [from the official site](http://www.python.org/download/). I am using Python 3.3.3 x64.

2. Download and install PyGame [for your chosen version of Python](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame).

3. Read documentation and hack away.
